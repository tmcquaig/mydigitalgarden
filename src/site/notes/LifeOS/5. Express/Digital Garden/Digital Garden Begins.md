I have enjoyed setting up this Digital Garden but haven't spent much time actually publishing anything.

From when I started until now has been quite a journey with Obsidian. What began as looking into a better way to share information with the world has turned into.. well... a second brain.

That's right. I said it. A Second Brain. This is a concept that goes well with PARA Method and Periodic Notes and together form a second brain. A powerful way of managing digital information and knowledge. Since then artificial intelligence in the form of chatbots accessible through various websites and API's have been creeping into all of my workflows. Now I am wondering what can I do next.
