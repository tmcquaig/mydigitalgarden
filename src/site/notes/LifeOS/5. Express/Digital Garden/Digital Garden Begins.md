I have enjoyed setting up this Digital Garden. It is an interesting workflow to use my note taking tool, Obsidian, and publish certain notes to my website here.

From when I started until now has been quite a journey with Obsidian. What began as looking into a better way to share information with the world has turned into.. well... a second brain.

A second what? A Second Brain. When I heard this term it really resonated with me. I was reading about the P.A.R.A. Method for gaining a better handle of the sprawl of information in my life. Combined with Periodic Notes to drive focus and almost a bit of a journal of the days. 

The PARA method is a simple way to think of all digital information and knowledge. Time bound knowledge that is progressing towards a goal. Knowledge about a things that I have to maintain or spend effort on because they are important to me. Knowledge about things that I like or use. Things that are worth keeping but I won't need for a long time. And a way to share any of this with more than just myself. Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives... PARA.

Since adopting para and parodic note taking artificial intelligence in the form of chatbots accessible through various websites and API's have been creeping into all of my workflows. Now I am wondering what can I do next by combining this concept of a second brain and what is available today in the AI space.

Here let's have that last paragraph rewritten by AI to be more empathetic.

"Since embracing the power of note-taking artificial intelligence, I've felt a sense of wonder and excitement as I've witnessed the transformative impact it has had on my workflow. The seamless integration of these chatbots into my daily routine has sparked a curiosity within me, leading me to contemplate the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to explore the uncharted territories of AI and uncover the potential synergies between the second brain concept and the cutting-edge advancements in this rapidly evolving field."

That was done in about 2 seconds all right here inside of Obsidian with the use of a plugin and an API key. Amazing!
