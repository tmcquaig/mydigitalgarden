As a fellow human being I realize my limitations. These limitations are not impossibilities, rather they are the result of constraints and commitments. When I observe others which I do often, I learn often. A rewarding experience that enlightens me of some of the possibilities that humans have.

One possibility that I am thankful to be able to see daily is how well the woman I love is able to understand what our pets seem to need or want. She seems to be able to do this by observing them and remembering animal behavior and previous events and experiences. She is effectively using large amounts information and then uses that to determine the most likely thing the pets are interested in. This is Inference.

Inference is what the AI chatbots of today are doing. They have been trained on massive amounts of information. Made connections and relations to all of that data. Then when prompted, AI is responding with the most probable response, not just the answer but also the sentence structure, vocabulary, grammar, word choice, even ultimately the answer to something like 2+2=?, the 4 in a response is all part of the inference.

There is a Dale Carnegie book called [[LifeOS/3. Resources/books/How to stop worrying start living - Dale Carnegie\|How to stop worrying start living - Dale Carnegie]] that talks about how decisions are easier the more data we have. The challenge I find is there is so much data, and distracting data, that while we do successfully derive insights, we leave a lot on the table. AI changes that by ingesting all of the data and more, well beyond our capacity, and then can derive insights at a much great scale in terms of speed and quantity. This will unlock many things, communication with animals will be one of them.

I see a future where the amount of data we can capture on animal behavior, sounds, and other context clues will allow AI to "translate" into a human language such as English for us to be able to understand and essentially communicate with our pets, and indeed other animals. We already see animals., especially those who we believe to be more intelligent, making efforts to communicate with us. 

So once again I am so excited to be living in the future and looking forward to all of the amazing experiences that are ahead.
